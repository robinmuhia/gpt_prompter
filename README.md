# Ayira's Affirmations

This is a 'Words of affirmation' web application that uses the OpenAI API to give words of affirmation. 

# Front-end infrastructure

The app has been created using Typescript, tailwind CSS and Next.js. The app uses Express.js for serverless functionality. This allows us to use Next-auth for authentication and connect with OPENAI API. The data is stored on MongoDB. The template and User Interface was forked from @javascript mastery. The app also uses a pinecone database to store vectors from a txt file allowing one to query the txt file for information.
